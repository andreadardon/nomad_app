Place.create(name: "Split, Croatia", description: "A nice studio apartment in the heart of Split. It's beautifully decorated and it is a nice place to come and rest after a long day working or touristing. The location is perfect and there are supermarkets and restaurants a couple of steps away. It is also located on the road to a beautiful park that have some of the nicest views of Split. The only bad thing is that since it is located on the ground floor of a highly transited street, the noises can be very loud making it hard to sleep or waking you up early in the mornings.", created_at: "2016-01-04 11:23:32", updated_at: "2016-01-14 16:54:28", image_url: "portablu1.png", internet_speed: "Over 30mbps", short_term_rental: "Yes", level_of_noise: "Bad", walkability: "Great", food: "Accessible", ac_heater: "Only AC")
